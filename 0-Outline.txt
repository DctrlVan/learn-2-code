### SECTION ONE: What is Programming? #
  Define the following:
    - What is a programming language?
      ~ A way to convert human readable text into
      machine language. Machine language can use the
      processing power and memory of the computer.
    - Each programming language has a grammer that is parsed or
    compiled.
    - The reserve words of a programming language are
    the building blocks. On top of those building blocks you
    define variables to hold information and functions to
    manipulate those variables.
    - All languages function in essentially the same way but
    they differ in important ways:
      - Abstraction
      - Efficiency
      - Read & Writability
      - Pervasiveness
      - Community
